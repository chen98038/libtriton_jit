"""An equal-to-one argument must be handed to Triton as a constant only.

Declaring it in the runtime signature as well leaves the compiler with two
descriptions of the same parameter. Triton folds it either way, so the emitted
code is identical, but the ASTSource -- and therefore the compilation cache key
-- stops matching the one the native Python runtime builds for the same call,
and the C++ and Python paths silently stop sharing compiled kernels.

The test intercepts ASTSource instead of compiling, so it needs no device.
